6645010,Roxbury,"I am going to say first that I adore my neighborhood.  However, what I adore about it seems to be the same attributes that make others uncomfortable or feel unsafe.  We live in an area of Boston known as Dorchester, specifically on the border of the Egleston Square section of Jamaica Plain.  This is a residential part of Boston that has been largely neglected by the city and overall development.  Therefore, the buildings are older, many sad and vacant.  The upside of this is that lower-income families are able to afford these homes and so we have a lot of kids and families in the area.  There is also a branch of the Boston Public Library two blocks away!  Franklin Park, one of the famous nature areas of Boston is visible from the corner of our street, and directly diagonal from the bus stop.  This is a great place to go for walks or get a run in in the early mornings (I've even seen people cross-country skiing when there is snow on the ground)!  A number of Bodegas are also within easy"
